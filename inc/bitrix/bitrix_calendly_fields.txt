I hope the Icoda team is open to partnerships and creating amazing staff!

Together with Paris-based creative agencies Brasassio and 3D Verso, we create the most unique and memorable events in both Web2 and Web3.

Recent Events and Highlights: 
- Polygon-powered villa at EthCC
- SportTech Pitching Panel at the Olympic Games in Paris
https://branched-stop-467.notion.site/Events-art-emerges-into-innovation-8dc1980d9a7f4f3db9f4c38e132bacdb?pvs=4

We’d love to collaborate with your agency to offer immersive, highly curated event formats that elevate client engagements through unique experiences.

🤝Our Partnership Offer:

We can serve as your dedicated event partner or contractor, providing project management and execution for immersive formats that include culinary experiences, live performances, unique decor, and 3D/AR/VR elements. 

We’re open to different forms of collaboration, whether that’s through a referral fee (starting at 10%), white-label production, or revenue sharing.

🫧Upcoming Opportunity: DevCon VC Networking Lounge: https://lu.ma/shy24nc9

We currently have a fantastic chance to team up for a side event at DevCon—a futuristic VC networking lounge aimed at top investors and founders

Our goal is to transport 200 guests into a high-tech, AI-inspired environment featuring spaceship decor, an AI host, and an impressive guest list filled with investors and up-and-coming startups.

The guest list is already open, and we’ve seen strong early interest from industry players like Supra, Aethir, Linea, and a range of VCs, including Outlier Ventures, Paper Ventures and NewTribe Capital

We’d love to discuss more about how we can collaborate to bring this event to life for some of your clients. 

I’d be very grateful for your feedback and happy to jump on an intro call to explore this collaboration opportunity!

I hope you’re doing well. My name is Won and I am a founder for G-KNOT. It’s a pleasure to connect with you.

At G-KNOT, we’re preparing to launch a groundbreaking Web3 security ecosystem based on the world’s first finger vein recognition technology. We’ve secured an exclusive partnership with a leading global firm—whose technology is already trusted by the United Nations and numerous other major organizations.

Unlike traditional crypto teams, our leadership includes visionaries from the creative industry, such as the former US CEO/ Creative director of Gentle Monster, as well as top executives from IMG WME and former officials from both the U.S. and Korean governments.

We’re currently gearing up for our coin launch and would love the opportunity to discuss potential marketing strategies with you. If you’re open to learning more or have any questions, please feel free to let me know.

Thank you, and I look forward to exploring how we can collaborate.

Best regards,

My name is Prince from ProsperBet.com, and I am reaching out because I believe there is a fantastic opportunity for us to collaborate.

At ProsperBet, we are passionate about creating a top-tier betting experience for sports enthusiasts and gamers. Right now, we are looking to partner with platforms like yours—ones that already engage massive communities of bettors, gamers, and sports fans—to introduce ProsperBet to audiences in the gaming and betting space. Specifically, we are looking to collaborate in these areas:

High-Traffic Gaming/Betting Platforms
Showcase ProsperBet on icoda-affiliated gaming blogs, sports news hubs, and betting forums where players actively seek recommendations.
Niche Communities & Discussion Groups
Engage users in betting tip communities or odds comparison platforms where real-time data and trusted insights drive decisions.
Free Game and Software Download Hubs
Introduce ProsperBet to casual gamers exploring new platforms or app review sites.
Sports Analytics & Odds Tools
Partner on integrations with platforms that provide live scores, odds tracking, or predictive analytics to sports bettors.
Exclusive Promotions & Content
Co-create campaigns (e.g., branded odds boosts, VIP tournaments, etc) tailored to bettors, gamers, and sports fans.

We’d love to brainstorm how we can align these focus areas with icoda's strengths. Would you be open to a quick chat to discuss?

Looking forward to your thoughts!

Best,
Prince

At the Bitcoin Visa we’re helping clients join Portugal’s Golden Visa program but by holding Bitcoin. Clients have to invest €500,000 for 5 years to aquire an EU passport. Now that €500k can be in Bitcoin, in our regulated, insured fund, keeping the upside of Bitcoin, and get an EU passport practically for free.

We've processed 1,000+ Portugal Golden Visas already with our partners and now, we're looking to get this in front of the right audience—Bitcoin OGs with 10/15+ BTC who value security, mobility, and wealth protection.

Would love for you to bring:

1) The best KOLs in your network for this audience (Who may even want to go through the process themselves for a marketing campaign = no fees)
2) Marketing strategies to build trust and awareness
3) PR, social, or influencer ideas that will actually move the needle

Let me know a good time to connect. Looking forward to seeing what we can make happen.

Мы – компания ERA Wallet, стартап, разработавший собственный аппаратный криптокошелек, мы хотим запустить продажи.

На текущий момент у нас есть наш сайт, ряд презентационных материалов и социальные сети. Сейчас мы ищем агентство, которое могло бы взять на себя комплексный маркетинг и продвижение нашего продукта на рынок.

Подскажите, пожалуйста, с кем и когда можно провести созвон, чтобы обсудить задачу подробнее, а также чтобы вы могли оценить объем и стоимость работ для нас?

My name is Amine, and I am a manager at Sweep Resort (sweepresort.com). We are looking to leverage Meta ads to connect with our target audience but need to ensure we stay compliant with Meta’s strict policies on gambling-related content. Given that our business includes elements that could fall under these restrictions, we’re seeking a carefully crafted marketing strategy that promotes our services effectively while adhering to all guidelines.

We’d like your agency’s help to develop a Meta ads campaign that reaches our ideal customers, drives traffic to our website, and remains fully compliant with Meta’s advertising policies, especially those concerning gambling. Our goal is to create engaging ads that resonate with our audience without risking policy violations.
We’d love to discuss how your expertise can support us in achieving this. Please let us know your availability for a call or meeting to explore this further.

Thank you, 
Amine 
Manager, Sweep Resort

My name is Amine, and I am a manager at Sweep Resort (sweepresort.com). We are looking to leverage Meta ads to connect with our target audience but need to ensure we stay compliant with Meta’s strict policies on gambling-related content. Given that our business includes elements that could fall under these restrictions, we’re seeking a carefully crafted marketing strategy that promotes our services effectively while adhering to all guidelines.

We’d like your agency’s help to develop a Meta ads campaign that reaches our ideal customers, drives traffic to our website, and remains fully compliant with Meta’s advertising policies, especially those concerning gambling. Our goal is to create engaging ads that resonate with our audience without risking policy violations.
We’d love to discuss how your expertise can support us in achieving this. Please let us know your availability for a call or meeting to explore this further.

Thank you, 
Amine 
Manager, Sweep Resort

Hemos trabajado con áreas locales en el pasado, pero ahora estamos planeando una campaña importante y nos encantaría trabajar con usted.

¿Puede decirme si está abierto a cooperar en este momento? ¿Podrías compartir el kit de medios y los precios actuales de tus servicios? (video de revisión/integración)

Si tienes alguna duda para aclarar el proyecto, déjame saber.

Estamos dispuestos a discutir los términos de la cooperación para que sea beneficiosa para ambos. Esperamos su respuesta para discutir los detalles y comenzar a trabajar en ello, ¡gracias!

Un poco sobre el proyecto:
ArbitrageScanner.io es un ecosistema de herramientas para el análisis de blockchain (investigación/análisis de cartera, sentimiento), así como herramientas para encontrar oportunidades de arbitraje entre intercambios.

Brindamos a los usuarios herramientas funcionales para realizar análisis de mercado. No trabajamos con el dinero de los usuarios y no pedimos acceso a la API, lo cual es muy importante.

Productos similares: DexScreener, DexTools, Arkham, Nansen... y ahora estamos desarrollando herramientas que superan a nuestros competidores en términos de funcionalidad. Incluso los medios de comunicación de criptografía de primer nivel hablan de ello en sus artículos y colocan a ArbitrageScanner en el top 1: es posible que hayas visto nuestra mención en CoinCodex, CryptoDaily, CryptoNews, CaptainAltcoin y otros artículos.

            [COMMENTS] => Buen día ! Mi nombre es Danny y represento al proyecto ArbitrageScanner.io ( https://arbitragescanner.io/ ). Nos interesaría trabajar contigo y realizar un vídeo de revisión/incrustación en tu canal de YouTube.

Hemos trabajado con áreas locales en el pasado, pero ahora estamos planeando una campaña importante y nos encantaría trabajar con usted.

¿Puede decirme si está abierto a cooperar en este momento? ¿Podrías compartir el kit de medios y los precios actuales de tus servicios? (video de revisión/integración)

Si tienes alguna duda para aclarar el proyecto, déjame saber.

Estamos dispuestos a discutir los términos de la cooperación para que sea beneficiosa para ambos. Esperamos su respuesta para discutir los detalles y comenzar a trabajar en ello, ¡gracias!

Un poco sobre el proyecto:
ArbitrageScanner.io es un ecosistema de herramientas para el análisis de blockchain (investigación/análisis de cartera, sentimiento), así como herramientas para encontrar oportunidades de arbitraje entre intercambios.

Brindamos a los usuarios herramientas funcionales para realizar análisis de mercado. No trabajamos con el dinero de los usuarios y no pedimos acceso a la API, lo cual es muy importante.

Productos similares: DexScreener, DexTools, Arkham, Nansen... y ahora estamos desarrollando herramientas que superan a nuestros competidores en términos de funcionalidad. Incluso los medios de comunicación de criptografía de primer nivel hablan de ello en sus artículos y colocan a ArbitrageScanner en el top 1: es posible que hayas visto nuestra mención en CoinCodex, CryptoDaily, CryptoNews, CaptainAltcoin y otros artículos.

    [message] => Hi, Team ICODA!
I recently reviewed your website, https://icoda.io/, and carefully studied your company's offerings. After analyzing several platforms, I concluded that icoda.io could be a potential partner to promote our startup at its early stages.
Here’s a brief overview of our project:
1.	Green Energy Factories: We are collaborating with a company that designs and builds waste-to-energy plants. These factories use advanced technologies to minimize (almost to zero) the emission of harmful substances into the atmosphere.
2.	Merging Traditional Business with the Crypto Industry: We are exploring the integration of a traditional business model with a cryptocurrency-based economy to create a unique, high-tech project that incorporates the best aspects of the modern industry.
3.	Community-Based Funding: As part of our project, we aim to attract a growing community where each participant is willing to invest a minimum of £10 weekly for 250 weeks to purchase NFTs and tokens equivalent to one traditional share.
4.	Web3 Platform Launch: We are developing a website and mobile application using Web3 technology, where participants can invest and receive dividends from assets.
5.	Integration of Mid-Tech and NFT Tokenization: Our project uses smart contracts, launches NFT collections, and tokenizes real-world assets (RWA), offering investors an alternative to traditional stocks and equity in businesses.
At the moment, we are focused on the initial steps – raising awareness about the project, gathering funds for early-stage development, and forming the core of our community.
As part of our marketing initiatives, we have created two websites and a Telegram application:
• www.eng-c.com
• www.engc.club
• Telegram Link https://t.me/share/url?url=https://t.me/TradingXXXX_bot?startapp=1877426050&text=Hello my Friend! Let`s Play!
 
Additionally, we are developing a Telegram game (TMA), which will be used to test the referral system and attract new users.
I would be happy to discuss how Icoda.io can help us create a strong online presence, promote the project, and attract resources to the network.
Looking forward to your response and a discussion on potential collaboration.
Best regards,
Viorel

We're soon to be launching an Action Model project - users will download our browser extension to help us train our decentralised AI, in exchange for tokens.

In our first wave of targeting, we want as many KOLs, partnerships and influencers onboard, to really help us accelerate the launch.

We have an in-house marketing team, but we're looking for support with KOL outreach and management in particular.

Do you think this is something you can help us out with?

    [message] => Sure! Here's a general checklist and preparation guide you can use for a meeting about launching or improving a betting site, especially if you're discussing development, design, or investment:


---

Meeting Preparation for Betting Site Project

1. Business & Legal Foundations

Objective: What kind of betting site? (Sportsbook, casino, exchange, etc.)

Target Market: Which country/region will it serve?

Licensing: What gambling license will be used? (e.g., Curaçao, Malta, UKGC)

Budget Range: Estimated budget for development, marketing, and licensing.


2. Technical Requirements

Platform Type: Will you use a white-label solution or custom development?

Core Features:

Live betting / in-play

Pre-match odds

Casino games / slots

Multi-bets (accumulators)

Payment gateway (Crypto, cards, local methods)


Third-Party Integrations:

Odds feed providers (e.g., BetRadar, BetConstruct)

KYC/AML services

Customer support (chatbots, helpdesk)



3. Design & Branding

Logo / Branding Ideas: Colors, fonts, tone

Website Style: Clean and professional or edgy and fun?

Mobile First: Should be fully mobile-responsive or app-ready


4. Marketing & Monetization

Affiliate System: Will you have an agent or affiliate model?

Retention Strategy: Bonuses, free bets, VIP levels?

User Acquisition Plan: Ads, influencers, SEO?


5. Security & Risk

Fraud Prevention: Anti-cheat and multi-account detection

Data Security: SSL, DDoS protection, secure storage

Fair Play / RNG Audit (for casino)

Would you like me to create a slide deck or a more detailed document you can share with your team during the meeting?

The token will provide holders with exclusive access to:
	•	Fractionalized property ownership opportunities
	•	Short-term luxury villa stays and high-end holiday experiences
	•	Premium wellness and beauty services (e.g., anti-aging, dental, body sculpting)
	•	Access to events, retreats, and VIP investor experiences

It is not a meme coin, NFT, or GameFi token. This is a Real World Asset (RWA) Token designed for utility, lifestyle access, yield potential.

⸻

Launch Goals:
We’re aiming for a Primary Launch in Indonesia (late Aug / Sept 2025) followed by a Global Launch (Q4 2025). Key objectives include:
	•	Building credibility with both crypto-native and traditional investors
	•	PR/media placements in Tier 1 outlets like Cointelegraph, Yahoo Finance, Decrypt, and possibly mainstream media
	•	Strategic influencer engagement for awareness and conversions
	•	Clear positioning to avoid being lumped in with meme or speculative tokens

Main Goal:  Sell Tokens like crazy on launch day

    [message] => We’ve just launched 10xFun.io — a meme token launchpad built on BNB Chain, inspired by Pump.fun but with a unique twist.

Here’s what sets us apart:
Every time a token completes its bonding curve (15 BNB raised), one lucky buyer wins 10x their largest buy (max 3 BNB).
Example: Buy with 0.1 BNB → token hits the target → win 1 BNB.

We also have a referral system where users earn 25% of the transaction fees generated by traders they bring in.

We want to start a marketing campaign to get users to create tokens and others to trade them

We’re currently preparing for a €40 million presale to support the development of industrial-grade quantum hardware, global network expansion, and the broader MIC ecosystem. At its core, MIC is building a tokenized, quantum-resistant compute layer optimized for AI acceleration and next-generation Web3 applications.

As we move toward this major milestone, we’re seeking to collaborate with a leading marketing partner to support global presale execution — spanning strategy, PR, KOL outreach, and community growth.

If this aligns with your focus, we’d love to connect at your convenience. Happy to share further details or provide an intro deck upon request.

    [message] => Good morning,

I want to share some information about who we are and what we offer.
I represent a group of companies, and we originally started as a product team.
Our first project was launched in 2021, and we continue to develop it to this day.
Here’s some information about the project:
https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/dexe/

In addition to that, we have an in-house trading group that includes:
 • a team of algorithmic traders,
 • a team of quants,
 • DevOps specialists,
 • proprietary algorithms developed from scratch with deep AI integration.

We build treasuries and focus on profit trading for our own projects as well as for partner projects.
Currently, we have a pool of 30 projects that are generating profits with us.

With you, I’d like to discuss a partnership where we can establish a deal flow exchange and share contacts from our networks.

Best regards.

My name’s Mustafa, I’m reaching out on behalf of PlayEmber — a small but well-funded GameFi / Web3 mobile gaming studio.
We’ve just secured new funding and want to start running paid ads ASAP to scale user acquisition.

We’re looking for an agency that can take full ownership of the advertising process — from strategy to creatives, launch, and weekly optimization.

    [message] => I want to completely remove my presence as an adult content creator from Google and all other online spaces. My objective is to be fully forgotten and disconnected from any adult references, images, videos, leaks, tags, mentions, and indexing.

What I Need From Your Agency

I require a full, comprehensive service that includes:
• Content removal from all websites hosting or reposting my material (DMCA takedowns, copyright claims, removal requests).
• Search engine de-indexing (Google, Bing, Yahoo), including amendments to auto-complete, image search, and name associations.
• Removal of leaked content on forums, Telegram channels, adult sites, free content sites, mirrors, and any re-uploading services.
• Monitoring and ongoing takedowns, as adult content often reappears through automated reposting.
• Personal data and name removal from adult directories, creator databases, leaked-content sites, and any archive platforms.
• Online reputation rebuilding, ensuring positive content appears instead of adult-related search results.
• Privacy protection measures, including suppression of old listings, cached pages, and indexing backups.
• Long-term monitoring, including alerts for new uploads or mentions of my previous adult activity.

Additional Needs
• I would like my name fully detached from adult content on search engines.
• I would like advice on the best structure to rebuild my public image under my new professional identity.
• I am open to long-term maintenance support if needed.

Please let me know:
1. The process you follow
2. Timelines
3. Costs and packages
4. What information you need from me to begin the takedown process

Thank you in advance. I look forward to your response and hope we can begin as soon as possible.

Best regards,
Roberto"

            [COMMENTS] => I want to completely remove my presence as an adult content creator from Google and all other online spaces. My objective is to be fully forgotten and disconnected from any adult references, images, videos, leaks, tags, mentions, and indexing.

What I Need From Your Agency

I require a full, comprehensive service that includes:
• Content removal from all websites hosting or reposting my material (DMCA takedowns, copyright claims, removal requests).
• Search engine de-indexing (Google, Bing, Yahoo), including amendments to auto-complete, image search, and name associations.
• Removal of leaked content on forums, Telegram channels, adult sites, free content sites, mirrors, and any re-uploading services.
• Monitoring and ongoing takedowns, as adult content often reappears through automated reposting.
• Personal data and name removal from adult directories, creator databases, leaked-content sites, and any archive platforms.
• Online reputation rebuilding, ensuring positive content appears instead of adult-related search results.
• Privacy protection measures, including suppression of old listings, cached pages, and indexing backups.
• Long-term monitoring, including alerts for new uploads or mentions of my previous adult activity.

Additional Needs
• I would like my name fully detached from adult content on search engines.
• I would like advice on the best structure to rebuild my public image under my new professional identity.
• I am open to long-term maintenance support if needed.

Please let me know:
1. The process you follow
2. Timelines
3. Costs and packages
4. What information you need from me to begin the takedown process

Thank you in advance. I look forward to your response and hope we can begin as soon as possible.

Best regards,
Roberto"

I’m reaching out because ICODA seems well-aligned with early-stage crypto projects that need practical, execution-driven marketing without enterprise-level overhead.

We’re intentionally keeping our launch lean and disciplined, focusing on:
	•	Community traction
	•	Select influencer or KOL outreach
	•	Optional PR or earned media where it actually moves the needle

Budget is controlled, but we value partners who understand how to deploy limited capital effectively during launch.

If this sounds aligned, I’d appreciate learning:
	•	How ICODA supports early-stage launches on smaller budgets
	•	What services you’d prioritize in the first 6–8 weeks
	•	Any relevant examples or case studies

    [message] => Hello Icoda Team,

Hope you’re doing well.

My name is Yalun, and I represent Nexify Media, an international marketing agency working closely with tech and web3 brands on influencer and community-driven campaigns across Europe.

We are currently supporting UM as our client and are in the process of shortlisting agency partners for a time-sensitive campaign in the DACH region, with a strong focus on Germany. We aim to finalize partners very shortly and move into execution immediately.

Campaign Overview
Target Region: DACH (Germany as priority)
Collaboration Type:

Mid-tier & Micro KOLs

Strong preference for community-based collaborations (not limited to Facebook / Telegram / WhatsApp; forums, Discord, niche financial communities are also welcome)

Verticals / Topics:
Forex · CFD Trading · Online Trading · Crypto Trading · Finance-related communities

Content Direction:

Brand exposure and awareness for Ultima Markets

Introduction of UM’s products and key advantages

Content format and angle can be adapted freely based on each KOL’s style and audience (no rigid content restrictions)

Timeline:

Campaign is scheduled to go live in Feburary

Budget:

USD 3,000 – 4,000 (USDT) depending on KOLs and collaboration structure

Budget is already approved and allocated

About Ultima Markets
Regulated with FCA / FSC licenses

Official partner of Inter Milan (already displayed on the official website)

Website: https://www.ultimamarkets.com/

We’ve also prepared a concise document outlining UM’s core strengths and selling points, available here:
👉 https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TmAfXi-zlbM0oeH5CGXed-s27jN1KcdCab9-dTlle8o/edit

Next Steps
At this stage, we are quickly reviewing:

Immediately available KOLs or communities in the DACH financial / crypto space

Recommended collaboration formats and pricing

Relevant case studies or prior experience in Germany

If this aligns with your focus, we’d appreciate your initial light proposal in the coming days, as we expect to confirm partners and lock resources soon.

Happy to jump on a quick call if needed — we’re moving fast on this.


Best regards,

Ault Blockchain ecosystem with three interconnected products: 
 
1. AULT BLOCKCHAIN: Finance-first EVM Layer-1 (Cosmos SDK + full EVM compatibility) with + Licensed Mining Node licenses). DAO-governed via Wyoming DAO LLC. Initial testnet completed, protocol security audit done. Ault Scanner (block explorer) and Hub (network coordination) reaching testnet late February. Native DEX in Phase 1 devnet. Mainnet Genesis Q2 2025. Licensed nodes perform verifiable off-chain services (VRF at launch, oracle/AI workloads over time). Partnerships: QuickNode, Protofire, LayerZero. 
 
2. ONLYBULLS: Live financial super-app (iOS/Android App Stores NOW) providing financial interface and DeFi gateway with wallet functionality (where mining rewards will flow) + real-time market data (stocks - soon crypto) + askROI AI assistant + news feed + trading tools (coming soon) + social community + dApp browser. NOT just a wallet - it's market access platform built on Ault infrastructure.  
 
3. BITCOIN MAX (BMAX): Launching end of Febuary 2025. IMMEDIATE NEED: Professional community management (Discord, Telegram, social channels). No advertising campaigns permitted yet - community building and moderation only during pre-launch phase.
 
THREE USER JOURNEYS: 
 
Infrastructure Operators: Acquire Licensed Mining Node license → Operate licensed node software → Perform verifiable work (VRF/oracle/data) → Earn deterministic $AULT emissions → Optional DAO governance participation 
 
Financial App Users: Download OnlyBulls → Create account → Create wallet → Fund wallet → Trade on DEX/use financial products → Earn rewards → Refer friends 
 
Developers/Builders: Deploy EVM smart contracts on Ault (unmodified) → Leverage fast finality, cross-chain (Cosmos IBC), licensed services → Build DeFi, data, enterprise dApps 
 
TRACTION & MILESTONES: 
 
Initial closed testnet completed, validated consensus, licensed node participation, protocol mechanicsProtocol security audit completed (third-party architectural review) Ault DAO framework established under Wyoming DAO LLC (governance mechanics, voting caps, quorum thresholds defined) 
 
Tokenomics published (fixed supply, deterministic emissions, validator/node incentive separation)
 
OnlyBulls & AskROI live on Apple App Store and Google Play with active users (pre-mainnet app traction) 
 
Native spot DEX in Phase 1 devnet (validating trading, settlement, execution)
 
Infrastructure partnerships executed: 
 
QuickNode (RPC), Protofire (protocol engineering), LayerZero (cross-chain)Ault Scanner + Hub development underway (testnet late February)
 
Core Cosmos + EVM architecture complete (Ethereum contracts deploy unmodified)
 
Public testnet launching imminently (node operator onboarding)$AULT emissions to begin distributing end of Q1 2025Bitcoin Max launching end of February 2025
 
Founded by Milton "Todd" Ault III - 35+ years across financial markets, real estate, private equity, energy, technology, and digital infrastructure. Early involvement in Bitcoin mining and data centers. Infrastructure-first mindset treating blockchain as foundational layer for markets, data integrity, and AI systems. Self-funded by Ault Capital Group, NOT VC-backed and NOT funded by token sales. This is institutional-grade infrastructure, not pump-and-dump.
 
What is your business goal for the marketing campaign?
 
Need agency that understands ECOSYSTEM MARKETING with multiple conversion funnels, not single-product campaigns. Previous agencies failed at this. 
 
GOALS: 
 
1. Drive wallet creation & FUNDING in OnlyBulls (top funnel) - ASO, paid ads, influencers emphasizing funding not just downloads. Retargeting for downloaded/created account/created wallet but not funded. 
 
2. Activate funded wallets for trading (mid funnel) - in-app education, push notifications with opportunities, first trade incentives, tutorials 
 
3. Convert traders to ecosystem participants (bottom funnel) - rewards programs, referral incentives, community engagement, advanced features 
 
4. Build institutional awareness for AULT BLOCKCHAIN - tier-1 media, developer marketing, thought leadership 
 
5. URGENT: Bitcoin Max (BMAX) Community Management (launching end January 2025) - CRITICAL IMMEDIATE NEED: Professional community setup starting NOW (Discord, Telegram, Twitter). Pre-launch community building WITHOUT advertising campaigns (compliance restrictions). Educational content and moderation only. Timeline: Infrastructure needed within DAYS - launch is end of month.
 
6. Ault Blockchain ecosystem growth strategy (Q2 onwards):  
 
UNDERSTAND THE THREE DISTINCT AUDIENCES:  
 
A) Infrastructure Operators (Licensed Mining Nodes + Validators):Acquire Licensed Mining Node licenses (perpetual infrastructure participation rights)Operate licensed node software performing verifiable off-chain services:  - Launch: Cryptographic randomness (VRF) for on-chain applications, governance, fairness  - Future: Oracle services, data indexing, distributed AI workloads Earn deterministic protocol emissions in $AULT for verified work Validators stake $AULT, secure network via CometBFT consensus, earn gas fees/tips Marketing: Technical documentation, infrastructure operator communities, validator recruitment    
 
B) Developers & Builders (EVM Ecosystem): Deploy Ethereum smart contracts unmodified (full EVM compatibility) Build on Cosmos SDK Layer-1 with fast finality, cross-chain interoperability (IBC) Leverage licensed services (VRF, oracles, AI workloads) Create DeFi protocols, trading platforms, data applications, enterprise dAppsMarketing: Developer grants, hackathons, technical documentation, EVM tooling, developer communities    
 
C) Institutional/Enterprise Partners (RWA & Financial Services):Tokenize real-world assets (equities, funds, commodities, financial instruments)
 
Use Ault as neutral settlement layer for financial workflows Integrate with custody providers, APIs, compliance-oriented processes Deploy institutional-grade financial applications
 
Marketing: Institutional outreach, RWA use case studies, compliance messaging, enterprise BD  This is NOT just an app - once mainnet is live, we need infrastructure-layer marketing across ALL three audiences
 
7. Professional community management (Ault Blockchain + OnlyBulls + BMAX) - Discord, Telegram, Twitter, in-app (full-time pros, not meme-makers)
 
8. Funnel optimization - analytics, A/B testing, identify drop-offs at each stage, weekly reporting
 
9. Strategic influencers - tier 1-3 influencers showing REAL wallet funding and trading with full attribution
 
10. Paid acquisition - Google, Twitter, TikTok, YouTube, Reddit with focus on wallet funding conversion KEY METRICS: 
 
OnlyBulls: App installs → Account → Wallet created → WALLET FUNDED → First trade → Active trader → Referrals | CAC, LTV, retention, funding rate
 
Ault Blockchain (post-mainnet): Developers building on Ault, validators active, TVL, cross-chain volume, RWA assets tokenized, dApp ecosystem growth
 
Bitcoin Max: Community size (Discord/Telegram members), engagement rates, readiness for launch
 
TIMELINE:
 
NOW - End January 2025: URGENT Bitcoin Max + Ault Blockchain Telegram/Reddit/Discord ASAP establishing and managment community management setup + OnlyBulls wallet funding focus
Late January 2025: BMAX launches (professional community management critical) 
 
NOW-Feb 2025: OnlyBulls wallet funding focus + Public testnet launch with node operator onboarding + Ault Scanner/Hub reach testnet (late Feb) + $AULT emissions begin (end Q1)
 
Q2 2025: MAINNET GENESIS - triple strategy execution:  - Ault Blockchain: Mainnet goes live, validator network activated, licensed nodes operational, native DEX transitions to mainnet, RWA tokenization capabilities go live, cross-chain integrations (LayerZero/IBC) operational  - OnlyBulls: Sustained growth, trading activation, rewards flowing to users- Bitcoin Max: Post-launch growth, eventual ecosystem integration
 
Q2-Q4 2025: Ecosystem expansion - Developer adoption, DeFi protocol integrations, institutional RWA partnerships, validator network growth, TVL growthBUDGET: $50-100K/month for ecosystem-level campaign (app marketing + blockchain infrastructure PR + developer marketing + community + paid acquisition + influencers + BMAX community management + post-mainnet campaigns) 
 
REQUIREMENTS:
 
Multi-product ecosystem experience
Funnel optimization expertise 
Remarketing at different funnel stages (downloaded/account/wallet/funded/traded)Professional community management 
(URGENT for BMAX) Compliance-aware (especially BMAX advertising restrictions)
Data-driven 
Focus on wallet FUNDING as primary metric for OnlyBulls
CRITICAL: Experience marketing blockchain infrastructure (developer adoption, validator networks, DeFi ecosystem growth) not just consumer apps
URGENT: Ability to deploy community management resources IMMEDIATELY (within days) for BMAX launchTHIS IS A
